"# dailyProgrammerPostingAndFormatting" 
This project is about creating a post on the dailyProgrammer subreddit
so that I don't have to reformat my code and post it to the subreddit by hand.

Goals for this project and progression:
1) Create functionality for formatting the post that will be sent to the subreddit. Possibly make a file, possibly not.
   a) first line will be the url of the reddit post (will be removed when submitted to the post).
   b) second line should state the programming language and version.
   c) third section should be the solution of the program. 
   d) fourth section should be a description of the file if there is one.
2) Submit the solution to the reddit post using the reddit api.

How to use:
	\nrun reddit_access.py from the command line like so:
	\n$ python reddit_access.py
	\nthen the program will take care of the rest! Pay attention though, as it will ask for some details.
